                    In 2020, the pandemic hit and changed the trajectory of traditional fitness for the worse; research
                    has shown that 9 out of 10 people say they plan to continue working out at home post-pandemic. How
                    do we bridge the gap between traditional solutions and at-home solutions so that fitness enthusiasts
                    are still meeting their goals?
                    <br><br>
                    By building in community support by design, we can make sure that fitness is accessible, motivating,
                    and most importantly, providing a sense of community and belonging.

        <div class="prjContent">

            <p>When asked, users said they owned some sort of smart device that has a camera, allowing them to bring
                these devices on the go wherever and whenever they went. We decided an app that can be opened on a
                desktop or on your mobile device would be the best option to accommodate our users.
                <br><br>
                Knowing this, I made sure to design responsively using a 12 column grid system so that users are
                able to use the web app fluidly on desktop or mobile. With that in mind, I took a mobile first
                design approach to focus on the essentials needed for the app and scaled up to desktop.

            <p>Here, I focused on user accuracy and how to display their progress so that users can work out in front of
                a live trainer and receive real-time feedback and data-driven metrics from MU's patent-pending
                technology.
                <br><br>
                Each person’s video feed would be enclosed in a thin, colored outline that would match the accuracy
                level at the time of the session. Considering accessibility and visual impairments, a number value is
                calculated and displayed with a matching color bar at the bottom of the screen. This bar can be opened
                or closed to view a real-time graph of your movement at any time.

            <p>We wanted to build in community support by design. With blue and it's variants being the primary color of
                the app, it gives a sense of trust and security as well as connection and community that users feel is
                lacking in current solutions. There was also a deliberate choice to have ample white space to make the
                app feel open and balanced.
                <br><br>
                In regards to the reward system, we decided to use the motif of high fives rather than a thumbs up or
                “upvote” as a way to motivate and reward each others’ success. Simulating a high five in this way
                celebrates connectedness with one another even when not in the same physical space. It’s a great way to
                increase cooperation and inspire trust with others within the community and platform.
